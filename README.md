AI Based Traffic Management system which prioritize the lane based on presence of Emergency vehicle

It calulate time for a particular lane based on no. of vehicle which were detected by YOLOv5.
And Emergency vehicle is detected by ResNet50.

RUN YOLO + PRIORITY file to see execution

Note: To get good accuracy train more no. of epochs on relevant data as i can't do it due to my machine constraints.
